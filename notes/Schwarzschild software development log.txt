Schwarzschild development log
=============================

Date           Description
----           -----------
03 Mar 2022    Fixed the Log4Shell critical vulnerability by using the latest Log4J2 version.
               Also switched to logging with Log4J2 via SLF4J.
04 Dec 2021    Found a bug in the cern.colt.matrix.linalg.Algebra.mult(DoubleMatrix2D dm1, DoubleMatrix2D dm2) method
               in the cern.colt.matrix package, so I decided to "roll my own" matrix manipulation class.
03 May 2021    Created BaseConsoleProgram, which is a console-based program
               that can be used as a start for user-interactive and -interruptible processing.
21 Jan 2021    Implemented smooth first derivatives (so that they never change
               from +ve to -ve or vice versa), in order to prevent sub-optimal
               solutions being found.
28 Dec 2020    •  Implemented minimising the sum of absolute values as an alternative
                  to minimising the sum of squares.
               •  Implemented completing calculations after 10 consecutive iterations
                  without improvement instead of the current 1.
               •  Removed the lib subfolder and its beansbinding-1.2.1.jar library file
                  from the dist folder.
13 Nov 2020    Fixed an error in calculating second derivatives (with respect to radius).
11 Aug 2020    Changed the radius step spacing to be closer together nearer the event horizon.
28 Jun 2020    Fixed the bug resuting in a greatly different sum of squares when resuming calculation
24 Jun 2020    Delayed the execution of enableOKAndResumeButtons(isStepFactorValid()) in
               m_scSchwarzschildWorker.addPropertyChangeListener(...) in order to get
               the “Resume” button to be enabled after the first run is stopped.
24 May 2020    Added a new "Results display" option for "Show nothing".
27 Apr 2020    Finished developing correcting (improving?) all second derivative calculations,
               and all first and second derivative estimate calculations at the ends of the curve.
12 Feb 2020    Finished improving the option of a simple test algorithm and whether to start
               close to the solution.
18 Jan 2020    Finished adding the option of a simple test algorithm and whether to start
               close to the solution, all in order to test the program's solution homing mechanism.
03 Dec 2019    Finished developing use of mid-run and final files to store interim and final results.
11 Nov 2019    Finished coding the method SchwarzschildWorker.loadFromResultsFile().
01 Nov 2019    Clicking the "Resume" button, for now, causes a "no-op" message dialog to be shown.
29 Oct 2019    Ensure that, if processing has been cancelled, the last iteration does not update
               the metric tensor.
25 Oct 2019    Coded the calling of the "save results" method on calculations "done".
20 Oct 2019    Interrupted a running iteration if the application is closed down rather than let it complete normally
